# Seamless View Theme for Obsidian

**Seamless View** is a custom CSS theme for Obsidian designed to provide a **unified and seamless experience** between the Live Preview and Read Mode, ensuring minimal visual differences when toggling between the two. This is particularly **useful for canvas elements** where cards have specific sizes, ensuring consistency in appearance when edit the content.
